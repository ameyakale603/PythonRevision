Operators
     1.	arity:-number of operands  //unary and binary
           eg: a+b   // binary
	   eg: !a    //unary

     2.  precedance: defines priority
		BODMAS rule

     
     3.  associativity:- two operators  of same priority will be evaluated
		right------>left     // unary,compound assignment(combinational assignments),ternary
		left-------->right   // all other operators
